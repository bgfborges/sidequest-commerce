# Sidequest Delivery Virtual Age Experience

The project goals to offer clients the necessary gadgets to have a good experience with the Delivery Virtual Age.

It's going to be developed with (React) NextJS - then it's possible to solve a React problem to the ecommerces, it means, the Search Engines to understand the code (as long as by default the React just render the page in the client side). With NextJS we have a necessary feature to this kind of application - the SSG and SSR. Respectively, the SSG (Server Site Generation) and SSR (Server Side Rendering) solves this problems, as long as when the Search Engine load the website, it's already sent (rendered) by the intermediate Next server.

## Skills and Technologies Avaliated on this POC Project

- React with TypeScript
- NextJS - Server Side Rendering (SSR), SSG
- Work with API Rest
- React Context API
- Componentization of Interface
- Testes: unitary | integration | E2E
- UI/UX - Building the Interface from zero for this project and client.
- Styled Components (to handle the CSS).

## Functional Requirements

- List API Products by Category.
- Add to cart.
- List Cart Products.
- Send Order to Backend.
- Unitary Tests.
- Mock the api values (it's written as optional, so for the best result I'll use a Fake API named https://fakestoreapi.com/ - and simulate a real daily job).

## Further Updates

- Documentation of Components
